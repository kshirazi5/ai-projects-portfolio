## **2️⃣ Make Each Project Stand Alone**
- Each project should have:
  - Its own **folder**
  - A **README.md** explaining what it does
  - Sample **input/output files** for testing
- This way, people can run them independently.

---

## **3️⃣ Add Demo GIFs or Screenshots**
- Use **Loom** or **ScreenToGif** to record short demos.
- Put them in each project README so visitors can *see* it in action without running code.

---

## **4️⃣ Pin It on Your GitHub Profile**
- Go to your profile → customize pinned repos → select this repo.
- This ensures recruiters see it first.

---

If you want, I can **write a polished README.md for your repo** right now so it looks ready for recruiters and LinkedIn.  
Do you want me to do that?
